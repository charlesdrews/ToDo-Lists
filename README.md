# Charlie's ToDo List App

This app allows the user to do the following:
*Create multiple todo lists
*View a list of all todo lists
*View each list in detail, showing the items that belong to that list
*Add items to each todo list
*Edit items - change title or detail strings, move item to a different list, or delete item
*Edit lists - change name or delete list

When the user creates or edits a list, they receive an error if they try to submit a blank list name. Similarly, if a user enters a list name that is already in use, they are notified that name cannot be used again.

When the user creates or edits an item, they receive an error if they try to submit a blank item title. Similarly, if a user enters an item title that is already in use in the specified list, they are notified that item title cannot be used again in that list.

The screenshots below demonstrate the app's user interface:
